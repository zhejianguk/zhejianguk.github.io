                                        Yuchen's research interests include the application of Large Language 
                                        Models (LLMs) in hardware design verification. Specifically, it focuses on integrating 
                                        LLMs with the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) to automate the testing 
                                        and repair of error-prone RTL codes, aiming to improve verification efficiency and 
                                        overcome the limitations of existing methods.
